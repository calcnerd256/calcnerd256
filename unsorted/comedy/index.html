Autobiographical standup routine

I'm not what you'd call "funny".
When you tell people you're gonna try your hand at comedy,
 everyone wants to tell you how to do it.
I'm so unfunny that I'm not offended by that.
When you tell people you're gonna try your hand at comedy,
 everyone wants to tell you how to do it.
What if other professions were like that?
 Imagine if a surgeon's auto mechanic tried to give him tips on how to hold a scalpel.
 Or if a musician's bank teller suggested a different chord.
Or if a boxer's landlord felt the need to remind him to keep his hands up.
What if an IT guy's grandma tried to teach him netiquette?
 That'd be like, "Now make sure you type in all caps so they can hear you."
 Or, "People love it when you forward those nice motivational e-mails to them."
  "It lets them know you're thinking about them."
 Or, "Don't forget to rebuild your external modules when you compile your kernel."
  "It guarantees that exported symbols resolve to the correct address."
  Yes, grandma, we know.
So I'm not exactly funny.
 I tried my hand over at that other place where we used to do the joke stuff.
  I told jokes that I liked, and then the following week, I went up on stage again.
  The next week after that, I heard that the place had closed.
   I guess you could say I killed it.
The things that usually make jokes funny are
 reversal of expectations,
 inside reference,
 and good pacing.
I don't care much about the timing aspect.
 I'm the kind of guy who will laugh at a joke after someone explains it.
 When I consume a joke, I treat it more as an artifact and less as a performance.
  That's why I can come here every week and hear the comedians perform the same jokes as last week
   and laugh every time as if it were brand new.
I'm not really good at writing my own jokes,
 but I feel like I can often take an already-formed joke and improve it a little bit.
I tend to overthink things. But sometimes I miss out on something really obvious.
 I'm that dream where you aren't wearing pants.
I'm pretty arrogant.
 I think that I can just walk in here with the tools I use to model a system and
  apply those tools to constructing funny jokes.
 The real comedians should all take it as an insult
  that I think I can get up on this stage and be funny.
I like jokes that require thought, and I like jokes that aren't very nice to the audience.
 Sometimes I laugh hardest when a comedian bombs,
  especially if they did it on purpose or aren't ashamed of it.
 I crack up if they just keep digging that hole deeper by trying to explain the joke.
  For me, the phrase "it's funny because" is funny all by itself.
I come from the parts of the Internet
 where repeating and recombining references to old jokes is considered funny.
Because I like absurd humor, I like to ask the other comedians the old "how X is it?"
 and to say "too soon" about things that aren't.
 I keep hoping they'll have really funny reactions instead of just getting annoyed at me
  for messing up their pacing.

 Would a reminder that you're going on a trashy talk show be a memento Maury?
 If you can't think of any areas in which you are currently imperfect,
  then the list should probably start with "introspection".
